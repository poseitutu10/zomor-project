In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### Project Task

Create a GitHub repository and develop a simple frontend application using Vue.js/NuxtJS (or React.js) to interact with the backend API you created in Part 1( if you are not doing part one, feel free to use this Graphql Server https://heny-api.core.zormor.com/graphql ). The frontend application should provide the following functionalities:

# Project Functionalities

1. Create a new place with name, description, location, open hours, and images upload.
2. View a list of all places.
3. View details of a single place.

### Requirements:

- Use Vue.js (NuxtJs) to develop the frontend application.
- Use mock data if you haven't completed the backend task.
- Write a README.md file with setup instructions, project overview, and explanation of your implementation.

### Submission Guidelines:

1. Create a new GitHub repository for your project.
2. Develop the frontend application according to the specified requirements.
3. Push your code to the GitHub repository.
4. Write a detailed README.md file explaining how to set up and run your project, along with any additional information about your implementation.

This web application is built in React js making use of TailwindCSS for styling. This miniproject is fully completed with all of its functional requirements achieved. Thus, a user can create a new tourist attraction by filling a form which requests for the name, description, location, open and close hours, and upload images. The values from the forms are then stored as a context API. The list of all places are displayed in addition to the newly created place. Lastly, the details of every single place is displayed with the use of dynamic routing. Due to inadequade knowledge and skills I have on Graphql Server, I didn't provide an interaction between the frontend and the Graphql server but I provided an interaction between the frontend and cloudinary when uploading the images with the use of axios. However, I can catch up with Graphql in no time although I also have a narrow understanding of postman, node js, express js, postgresql amd mysql. The frontend provides a responsiveness to variety of devices. The project has four main parts. They are the home page, experience, become a curator and register a new site.
